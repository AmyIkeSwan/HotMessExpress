April 11,2022 First practice- not everyone from our group was able to attend. We were able to  figure out some technical help for adding ASL and voice and recording. This was our first run through. Which gave us a very loose esetimate of time.

April 12,2022 Second attempt. After reviewing our recording we found that only video was showing for the person talking instead of showing our entire gallery of people. We searched on google for answers and thought we had a solution. Additional kinks were figured out for the next and hopefully last time to record.We had a better understanding of our time and thought we were at about 26 mins.

April 13, 2022 Third Attempt, gave us a pretty good sense of our overall time but did not correct our recording so it was determined that the best option was to do our presentation live instead of record it first. 

Our presentation was April 14, 2022. The 3 practices helped for a pretty smoth delivery even  with a breif WIFI issue.
